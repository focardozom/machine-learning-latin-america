This project was developed with the support of the *Expanding the Use of Collaborative Data Science at UM* initiative during the Fall of 2023 by the [Frost Institute for Data Science and Computing (IDSC)](https://idsc.miami.edu) at the University of Miami.

### Background :bulb:

While the United States has seen substantial growth in the application of Machine Learning techniques in public health, Latin America presents an untapped opportunity for expansion. This project aims to capitalize on this potential by harmonizing and sharing Machine Learning methodologies in the region, thereby fostering scientific inclusively and enhancing prevention science in Latin America.

---

### Objectives

1. To adapt Machine Learning teaching materials to be culturally and linguistically appropriate for Latin American researchers.
2. To disseminate these methodologies through academic and research collaborations.
